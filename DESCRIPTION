Title: Stock Assessment Tables and Figures
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Samantha Schiano, Bai Li, Steve Saul, Kelli F. Johnson, & Megumi Oshima
Maintainer: Samantha Schiano <samantha.schiano@noaa.gov>
Description: Creates exploratory and finished tables and figures for stock assessment 
  documents from U.S. stock assessment model outputs. This packages addresses 
  parts of the stock assessment workflow that interprets outputs of stock 
  assessment models as well as allows the analyst to create report ready tables 
  and figures, reducing the need to create their own and format then when adding 
  into a report. This package is intended to be used in conjuction with `asar`, 
  a partially automated template for writing various stock assessment reports.    
  Throughout development, we will be creating a set of standardized figures and 
  tables for a stock assessment report, developing functions to produce a variety 
  of diagonostic plots, and other helpful materials. The advantage of using this 
  package over others is that it applies to a range of stock assessment model outputs 
  and standardizes them.
