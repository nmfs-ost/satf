***Previously named 'satf'***

The goal of {stockplotr} is to create a centralized package that contains all of
the figures and tables for a stock assessment report used to inform management. 
There are multiple current packages that perform a 
similar function, but they are typically region and/or model dependent. Across 
the US, there are multiple packages that create plots that are directly used in 
a stock assessment report used for management. For example, an analyst that uses 
Stock Synthesis (SS3) to assess a stock will utilize [`r4ss`](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss/), 
a package that reads outputs, plots key parameters, and more to increase 
throughput and reduce tedious tasks for an analyst.

Please note that this package is still in development. As such, some functions 
are unstable and might not perform as intended. We encourage anyone who tests 
out this package to leave an [issue](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/stockplotr/issues)
for any errors you find or for a feature request.

## Installation

Install the package using one of the three following ways:

(1) Using `pak`

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("nmfs-ost/stockplotr")
```

(2) Using `remotes`

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nmfs-ost/stockplotr")
```

(3) From the noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox r-universe

```r
install.packages("stockplotr", repos = c("https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

## Usage

Please refer to the [{asar} tutorial](https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/asar_tutorial/#section-preparing-to-run-create_template) to learn how to produce the input file necessary to create figures and tables with {stockplotr}.

Then, once your converted model results are saved as an object in your R environment, you can use {stockplotr} functions to create plots from the object.

> [!TIP]
> {stockplotr} plots or tables are exported as `ggplot2` or `gt` objects 
> meaning that users can use the same process to add new data, formatting, or 
> other customizations to the plot beyond the baseline made by this package

### Example

```r
data <- stockplotr::example_data

# create a landings figure and table from your object
plot_spawning_biomass(data)
table_landings(data)

 ```

Example Plot | Example Table |
:------------|---------------:
![Example landings plot from stockplotr](man/figures/landings_plot_ex.png) | ![Example landings tables from stockplotr](man/figures/landings_table_ex.png)

## Progress, Goals, & Timeline

What are we working on? When do we aim to complete it? What have we accomplished? Check out our [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/nmfs-ost/projects/45/) and [Milestones](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/stockplotr/milestones) to see the package development status and our goals for the next few months.

## Code of Conduct

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

All contributors participating and contributing to the asar project are expected to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/stockplotr/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## User Community

We hope that this package will be able to be a one stop shop for plots regarding interpreting assessment models and presenting the results to managers and relevant stakeholders. We encourage interested users to contribute to this package using their custom code when they find it may be useful across the nation.

> [!NOTE]
> Model diagnostic plots within the [{Fisheries Integrated Modelling System (FIMS)}] (https://github.com/NOAA-FIMS/FIMS) are in development.
> These plots will work natively with {stockplotr} since the FIMS model output virtually matches the {stockplotr} standardized output format.
