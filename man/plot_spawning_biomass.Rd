\arguments{
\item{dat}{.csv file and path where the data is located of standard stock assessment output}

\item{model}{the model in which the output came from (standard, SS3, BAM, ect)}

\item{show_warnings}{Option to suppress warnings}

\item{units}{If units are not available in the output file, in metric tons,
or are different for SB and R, then report them here starting with SB units
and following with R units.}

\item{spawning_biomass_units}{units of spawning biomass if different from biomass}

\item{scaled}{T/F; indicate whether the output values for biomass and recruitment are scaled}

\item{scale_amount}{indicate the exact amount of scale (i.e. 1000)}

\item{ref_line}{choose with reference point to plot a reference line and use
in relative sb calculations}

\item{end_year}{input the end year of the stock assessment data (not including
projections). This parameter will be deprecated once the output converter is fully developed.}

\item{relative}{Plot relative spawning biomass. Ref line indicates which reference point to use}

\item{biomass_units}{units for biomass}
}
\value{
Plot spawning biomass from a stock assessment model as found in a NOAA
stock assessment report. Units of spawning biomass can either be manually added
or will be extracted from the provided file if possible. In later releases, model will not
